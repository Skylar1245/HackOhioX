Hack Ohio Challenge Dashboard Datasets  
All meter data pulls are hourly intervals from Jan 1, 2017 to present for buildings for natural gas, electricity, chilled water, heating hot water, steam, and total EUI (all available utilities summed together) in KBTU.   
If there are 0s for a given utility, that means there either is no meter installed at that time or no usage for that type of utility for a buildings (for example, not all buildings have chilled water meters because they do not use it, or a building may not have had a meter installed in 2017 and comes online much later).
Occupancy data is measured by number of device connections to the wifi network.   
There are three files: one that includes five examples of non-dorm buildings (Enarson, Knowlton, North Recreation, Denney, and Thompson); one that includes five examples of dormitory buildings (Taylor, Busch, Smith-Steeb, Baker, and Morrill); and one that includes NOAA weather data.   
Both building datasets have already undergone general cleaning from the raw meter data sources, but if you would like to further clean and manipulate the data before utilizing them to create your dashboards, feel free to do so.   
Make sure to create a minimum of one dashboard for a dorm building and one dashboard for a non-dorm building, but feel free to create more if you would like.   
If you are interested in a building that does not have its data included here, reach out to a mentor and they can pull that data for you from our Smart Institutions energy platform.
